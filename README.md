# Random Walk Simulation

This project simulates multiple random walks and visualizes the distribution of the final positions using Python.

## Description

The **Random Walk Simulation** project generates 500 random walks, each consisting of 100 steps. The simulation calculates the final position of each walk and visualizes the distribution of the final positions using a histogram.

## Features

- Simulates 500 random walks.
- Each walk has 100 steps.
- Final positions are visualized with a histogram.
- Includes randomness in steps based on dice rolls.
- Probability of returning to the starting point.

## Installation
